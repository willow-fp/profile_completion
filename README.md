1. Download the `profile_completion` module and extract it into your Backdrop modules directory (e.g., `/modules/profile_completion`).
2. Enable the module at `admin/modules`.
3. Configure the module at `admin/config/people/profile_completion`.

## Configuration

1. Navigate to `admin/config/people/profile_completion`.
2. In the **"Fields for Profile Completion"** section, select the fields to be included in the completion calculation.
3. Save the configuration.

The module will then use these fields to calculate each user's profile completion percentage.

> **Note:** The module currently does not support fields with conditional dependencies; fields must be general and applicable to all user roles.

## Usage

Add the **"Profile Completion "** block in the profile or wherever you want and this block shows:

- The completion percentage (e.g., "Your profile is 43% complete").
- A progress bar indicating the completion level.
- A motivational message if not 100% complete (e.g., "Complete your profile to reach 100%!").
- A button to edit the profile if not 100% complete.
- When 100% complete, a congratulatory message and a green progress bar.
